# This title plays on the repetition of open, and that might not work if your locale doesn't translate 'Open source'. You have the option to keep this string in English, if you think it can be easily understood and work well as a slogan, or use an alternative as a reference for translation: 'Support people over profits'.

## Branch: treatment-c

# This title is displayed together with the picture of a running fox with a long tail. In English, this is a figure of speech meaning 'stop something from following you'. If the localization of this message is challenging, consider using a simplified alternative as a reference for translation: 'Keep unwanted trackers away'.
