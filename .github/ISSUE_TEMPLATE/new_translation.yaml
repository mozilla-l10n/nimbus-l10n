        Please note that this workflow is designed for Nimbus experiments.


        To translate other types of content, please refer to [this

  - type: textarea
    id: info
    attributes:
      label: Information about the experiment
      description: >
        Provide as much context as possible about the experiment. This information
        will be useful to create the file with the strings to translate. Consider
        providing links to the experiment documentation, mock-ups, etc.
      placeholder: Tell us about the experiment.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: locales
    attributes:
      label: List of locales
      description: |
        Provide a list of the locales that need to be translated. Keep in mind that:
        * [Locales are not regions](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/documentation/localization/globalization_best_practices.html#region--language). So, you should request French (fr), not France.
        * We don't support all locales, for example we support a generic French (fr), but not Canadian French (fr-CA). You can find the [full list in Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/teams/), but feel free to reach out to the [Localization Team](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FIREFOX/pages/11045331/Localization+l10n+and+Translation) if you have any doubts.
      placeholder: Which locales are required.

    attributes:
      label: Deadline
      description: >
        Is there a hard deadline for the experiment? Keep in mind that getting
        translations will require at least 72h, shorter deadlines might require
        using pretranslation (automated translation).
      placeholder: YYYY-MM-DD
    validations:
      required: false
  - type: textarea
    id: strings
    attributes:
      label: Content to translate
      description: >
        Provide the content that needs to be translated. You can put it in the
        issue, or provide a link to an external document (e.g. spreadsheet).

        The more information you provide, the easier it will be to start the
        translation. For example, it's important to know in which context
        strings will be used (button label, title, etc.) or if there are length
        limitations.
